# Shared GD code

This project is designed to be high quality (as much as i can, but i suck hehe), to adhere to Godot standards and style guides, and to be useful to everyone, not just me.

Contents include:
- The GUT addon by bitwes for unit testing.
- Classes (primarily components designed like default Godot nodes).
- Tests for the classes.

# How to use

Download the project and delete anything you don't need.
- All the important stuff you actually need are in the classes folder, everything else is just helping me develop this project.

Copy-paste whatever you want in your project.

# License

This project is licensed under GNU GPL v3 which basically means you can do absolutely everything, except take away people's freedom to access the source code.

My goal is not to limit people, but to ensure the code is always accessible. If you want to use this and the license is incompatible, feel free to contact me.

GUT has its own license, respect it.

# Convention

I try to be as consistent as possible.
